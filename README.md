# E-Paper Digital Nametag

This projects creates a simple re-programmable E-Paper Nametag with the AVR64DU32 microcontroller (MCU). The MCU enumerates as a standard COM serial port when plugged into a computer. 

## Licensing

### Software 
- Code that is automatically generated by MPLAB&reg; Code Configurator (MCC) or pulled from a code example is licensed by Microchip (full agreement is in the header files).
    - The short version is that it is free to use/modify, so long as it uses a Microchip MCU.
- Code that I wrote (firmware and image loading scripts) is licensed under GNU AGPL v3
    - https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/ 

### Hardware 

- Hardware Design (Schematic and PCB files) are licensed under CERN OHL v2
    - https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cern-ohl-s-2.0/

## Software Setup

### Python Libraries Required (Not Included)

- [Python Image Library (Pillow)](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)
    - This library opens an image and reads the pixel values.
- [pySerial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
    - This library allows the script to send data over a COM port.

## Image Configuration  

- Size must be 212 x 104 pixels 
- Colors must only be Red/Black/White
    - The easiest way to achieve this is to use Indexed Color Mode in your image editor
        - Red = 0xFF0000 [255, 0, 0]
        - Black = 0x000000 [0, 0, 0]
        - White = 0xFFFFFF [255, 255, 255]
